DESCRIPTION:
‘A novel of such self-assurance, one can scarcely believe it is the author’s first. Its style is always confident and frequently studded with delightful felicities. Ghose brings to life dozens of minutely observed characters within a richly described social and political milieu even as she focuses on the journey from loss to self-discovery and fulfilment that her two protagonists make.’ 

‘An incisive portrayal of the abuse and exploitation that thrives as duty, perhaps even attraction, in relationships.’ 

‘How does Anindita Ghose know so much? Her sentences are like X-rays: nothing is hidden or can be hidden. Sad and funny and wise, The Illuminated is one of those books that will make you hug your loved ones tight.’ 

'Lyrical throughout yet so deceptively easygoing, The Illuminated is an extraordinary novel that catches your breath on the first page and simply won't let you put it down.’ -
